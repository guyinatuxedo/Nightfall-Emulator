This architecture has seven `8` bit registers, and three `16` bit registers. It also has 5 flags. In addition to that, the `8080` architecture uses `16` bit addresses:

```
A:	0x8 bit register	Accumulator register
B:	0x8 bit register	Higher 8 bits of BC Register
C:	0x8 bit register	Lower 8 bits of BC Register
D:	0x8 bit register	Higher 8 bits of DE Register
E:	0x8 bit register	Lower 8 bits of DE Register
H:	0x8 bit register	Higher 8 bits of HL Register
L:	0x8 bit register	Lower 8 bits of the HL Register

BC:	0x10 bit register
DE:	0x10 bit register
HL:	0x10 bit register

SP:	0x10 bit Stack Pointer Register 
PC:	0x10 bit Program Counter Register

F:	0x8 bit register	Each bit holds one of the following severn flags

7:	Sign (S Flag)	
6:	Zero (Z Flag)
5:	0 (It always holds the value 0)
4:	Auxillary (AC or H Flag)
3:	0 (It always holds the value 0)	
2:	Parity (P Flag)	
1:	1 (It always holds the value 1)
0:	Carry (C Flag)

0xe4	cpo adr		3 bytes	If the Parity flag is equal to 0, push the current PC plus 3 onto the stack, and call the address where adr is the last two bytes of the instruction
0xe5	push h		1 byte	The SP register is decremented, and the contents of H is stored where the address of SP points to. The SP register is decremented again, and the contents of L is stored where the address os SP points to
0xe6	ani x		2 bytes	Performs a bitwise and on the A register, and x (second byte of the instruction)
0xe7	rst 4		1 byte	Pushes the value of the PC register plus one onto the stack, then the PC register has the value 0x0020 moved into it
0xe8	rpe			1 byte	If the value of the Parity flag is equal to one, pop the top stack value into the PC register
0xe9	pchl		1 byte	Loads the contents of the HL register into the PC register
0xea	jpe adr		3 bytes	If the Parity flag is equal to one, the value adr (last two bytes of the instruction) are moved into the PC register
0xeb	xchg		1 byte	Exchanges the contents of the DE and HL registers
0xec	cpe adr		3 bytes	If the Parity flag is equal to 1, the current value of the PC register plus three is pushed onto the stack, then adr (last two bytes of the instruction) is moved into the PC register
0xed	No instruction
0xee	xri x		2 bytes	The value of the x (second byte of the instruction) is xored with the A register
0xef	rst 5		1 byte	Pushes the value of the PC register plus one onto the stack, then the PC register has the value 0x0028 moved into it


0xf0	rp			1 byte	If the Sign flag is equal to 0, return
0xf1	pop psw		1 byte	The memory location pointed to by the address stored in the SP register, is moved into the F register. Then the SP register is incremented, and then the value pointed to by it's address is moved into the A register, and the SP register is incremented again
0xf2	jp adr		3 bytes	If the Sign flag is equal to 0 jump to the address where adr is (last two bytes of instruction)
0xf3	di			1 byte	This resets the interrupt flip-flops, which prevents interrupt from triggering
0xf4	cp adr		3 bytes	If the Sign flag is equal to 0, push the current PC plus 3 onto the stack, and call the address where adr is the last two bytes of the instruction
0xf5	push psw	1 byte	The SP register is decremented, and the contents of A is stored where the address of SP points to. The SP register is decremented again, and the contents of F is stored where the address os SP points to
0xf6	ori x		2 bytes	Performs a bitwise or on the A register, and x (second byte of the instruction)
0xf7	rst 6		1 byte	Pushes the value of the PC register plus one onto the stack, then the PC register has the value 0x0030 moved into it
0xf8	rm			1 byte	If the value of the Sign flag is equal to one, pop the top stack value into the PC register
0xf9	sphl		1 byte	Loads the contents of the HL register into the SP register
0xfa	jm adr		3 bytes	If the Sign flag is equal to one, the value adr (last two bytes of the instruction) are moved into the PC register
0xfb	ei		1 byte	This sets the interrupt flip-flops, which allows for interrupts
0xfc	cm adr		3 bytes	If the Parity flag is equal to 1, the current value of the PC register plus three is pushed onto the stack, then adr (last two bytes of the instruction) is moved into the PC register
0xfd	No instruction
0xfe	cpi x		2 bytes	The value of the x (second byte of the instruction) is subtracted from the A register, and sets the corresponding flags based off of it. The value of the A register isn't changed.
0xff	rst 7		1 byte	Pushes the value of the PC register plus one onto the stack, then the PC register has the value 0x0038 moved into it
